## Installation

You  need IDE to play with all files, So just integrate with your IDE using git or download this code as zip and add project folder to you IDE explorer.
First of all you need to activate the virtual environment, I already provided 

## Project Motivation

Wanted to create a simple python package using OOP knowledge for flexibility calculating various methods.

## Functionalities

The main purpose of this is to find the Mean, Standard Deviation, probability density function of distribution and how can we add two distributions.

## File Descriptions

So, very first file you will see is setup.py which is essential for creating a package it has discription of this package. In the "ks-distribution" folder you will
find main python code for distributions. I have also provided one more README file in the folder containing more information about those files, do check it.

## Summary 

If I would have to put straight then you can calculate mean, std deviation, pdf, pmf of both gaussian and binomial directly from this package with histogram and bar
futher saying you can add two distributions too. Hope this finds you interesting, If you are doing something related to this then do check this package and let me know if it useful. Feel free to give suggestions if any.
